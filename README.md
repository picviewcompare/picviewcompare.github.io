# Pic View Compare
## Add images to the grid for gallery viewing or side by side comparison.
[Live Site](https://picviewcompare.github.io)

# ISSUES
- Single image fullscreen view, left right image rotate, followed by escape, images then appear slightly zoomed in when escaped back into their slots.

- clicking anywhere outside of dual view closes fullscreen but single view fullscreen doesn't (have to click current open image)

# TODO

- bulk dump 12 files directly into slot

- refactor code following tight.js reference
