# Pic View Compare
## Add images to the grid for gallery viewing or side by side comparison.
[Live Site](https://picviewcompare.github.io)

# ISSUES
- Single image fullscreen view, left right image rotate, followed by escape key, images then appear slightly zoomed in when escaped back into their slots.

- clicking anywhere outside of dual view closes fullscreen but single view fullscreen doesn't (have to click current open image)

# TODO

- configure number keys on keyboard as alt to buttons for dual view

- bulk dump 12 files directly into slots

- refactor code (see optimised.js reference)
